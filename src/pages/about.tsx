      <p><strong>Hi! I’m Andrew.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I live in San Francisco. I moved here in 2015 to work for{' '}
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801084220/https://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>,
        which was acquired by Microsoft in 2016. Since then, I’ve been working on developer tools
        at Microsoft.
      </p>

        I started programming poorly and building very bad web sites at around the age of eleven,
        and then I stopped for a long time until college, where I took a job in which sometimes
        I would break down cardboard boxes and other times would write very bad PHP and SQL.
        Eventually I moved on to writing very bad C# and JavaScript, stopped breaking down
        cardboard boxes, and did that until I got slightly less bad at it. (My SQL has not improved.)
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I earned a degree in electrical engineering, which I neither use nor
        regret. Vaguely knowing how electricity works is pretty fun, and I still sometimes start
        hobby electronics projects that are totally impractical and will never get finished.

        These days, I write a lot of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>
        and <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>. Aside from that, I try to spend my time doing things
        outside. One time I walked <a href="https://appalachiantrail.org">really far</a>, and I’ve
        biked across <a href="https://500px.com/atcb/galleries/scandinavian-bike-tour">a few small
        countries</a>. Once a year or so I struggle to use up all 36 exposures on a roll of color
        film. And very occasionally, I vastly underestimate the ambitiousness of a project like
        this blog and pour dozens of hours into it for dubious gain. This happens to be one of the
        few that I’ve finished, so, hope you enjoy. ❤️
